 To-Do:
 -Merge all three types of trackers on the same tracker by using lua (no idea how haha)
 -Get a better picture of Botwoon -> Improved but wrong palette on the head
 -Get a better picture of Crocomire -> DONE
 -Maybe make better graphics for the metroid rooms? Works better with 64x images or smaller
 -Maybe make a Go Mode toggle? Well, if enough people show interest...
 -Make the Chozos objective -> DONE
